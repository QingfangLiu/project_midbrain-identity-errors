# Midbrain-OFC Prediction Error Project

**"Midbrain signaling of identity prediction errors depends on orbitofrontal cortex networks"**

This project combines TMS, fMRI, and computational modeling to understand how the midbrain encodes identity-based prediction errors and how this is influenced by orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) networks. The repository includes code, documentation, and materials supporting the research paper.
