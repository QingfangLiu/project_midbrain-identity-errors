# Midbrain-OFC Prediction Error Project

**"Midbrain signaling of identity prediction errors depends on orbitofrontal cortex networks"**

This project combines TMS, fMRI, and computational modeling to understand how the midbrain encodes identity-based prediction errors and how this is influenced by orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) networks. The repository includes code, documentation, and materials supporting the research paper.

This repository contains code that processes the raw data. In contrast, a separate repository was published alongside the paper, which starts from a processed file (SourceData.xlsx) and contains the code used to generate the figures:
